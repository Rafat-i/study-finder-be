## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB database

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rafat-i/study-finder-be.git
cd study-finder-be
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project (see Environment Variables section below)

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Update the API URL in `src/environments/environment.ts` to point to your backend:
```ts
export const environment = {
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5000'
};
```

4. Start the frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:4200`.
